/*
 * A simple five-level FIFO queue scheduler.
 *
 * There are five FIFOs implemented using BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE. A task gets
 * assigned to one depending on its compound weight. Each CPU round robins
 * through the FIFOs and dispatches more from FIFOs with higher indices - 1 from
 * queue0, 2 from queue1, 4 from queue2 and so on.
 *
 * This scheduler demonstrates:
 *
 * - BPF-side queueing using PIDs.
 * - Sleepable per-task storage allocation using ops.prep_enable().
 * - Using ops.cpu_release() to handle a higher priority scheduling class taking
 *   the CPU away.
 * - Core-sched support.
 *
 * This scheduler is primarily for demonstration and testing of sched_ext
 * features and unlikely to be useful for actual workloads.
